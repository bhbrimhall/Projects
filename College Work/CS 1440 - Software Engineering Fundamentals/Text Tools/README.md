# Text Tools

## Purpose of this Assignment
For this assignment I was tasked to recreate the classic suite of Unix text processing tools in Python. I was required to document my time I spent on the assignment and my plan to complete it. I had to document the project requirements, design, implementation, testing, and maintenance. I had to treat it like I was engineering software for an actual company.

## How to Run
1. In your terminal, run the `tt.py` python file. It will show you how to use the different text tools. Some example data is provided in the `test_data` directory.
