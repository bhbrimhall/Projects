| Date      | Time Spent  | Events
|-----------|-------------|--------------------
| October 2 | 1 hour      | Read README and looked at what the functions are supposed to do. Took starter code quiz.
| October 8 | 10 hours    | I once again looked over README.md, the requirements, and the plan.md. I designed the functions in Phase 1 of plan.md and wrote the appropriate psuedocode. I then wrote all the functions in the assignment while also editing the tt.py file too. I then documented some tests that I ran to test my functions.
| October 9 | 1.25 hours  | Finished documenting the tests for the programs and functions. Pushed assignment to GitLab. I finished the last phase of plan.md and answered the questions. I then pushed the assignment again.
| TOTAL     | 12.25 hours
