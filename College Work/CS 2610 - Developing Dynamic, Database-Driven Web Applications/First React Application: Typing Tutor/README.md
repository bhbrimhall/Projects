# First React Application: Typing Tutor

## Purpose of this Assignment
This was my first assignment using the Javascript React library in cooperation with the Vite framework/tool. I was assigned to reproduce a finished typing tutor that was given to me by my professor. We had access to the client-rendered HTML and CSS, but had to figure out the React stuff on our own. The objectives of this assignment were to:
  * Build a React application
  * Apply unidirectional dataflow
  * Deal with side effects
  * Practice analyzing existing systems to determine requirements

## How to Run
1. Run `$ npm run build` to install the dependencies.
2. Run `$ npm run dev` in your terminal to start the server.
3. Go to your browser and go to "localhost:5173". The page should pop up.
