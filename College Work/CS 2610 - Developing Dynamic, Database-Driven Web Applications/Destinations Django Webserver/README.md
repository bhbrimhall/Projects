# Destinations Django Webserver

## Purpose of this Assignment
For this assignment I was tasked to build an application that lets users record a history of places they have visited. The focus of this assignment was to implement user authentication and data ownership. The objectives were to:
  * Implement session-based authentication
  * Build an application where users can share their data publicly

User-friendly CSS was required. Not as much effort was put into styling compared to other components.

## How to Run
1. Run `$ poetry shell` in your terminal to spawn into a virtual environment.
2. Run `$ python manage.py runserver` in your terminal to start the server.
3. Go to your browser and go to "localhost:8000". The page should pop up.

## Screenshots of Application
Here are a few screenshots of the running application.
