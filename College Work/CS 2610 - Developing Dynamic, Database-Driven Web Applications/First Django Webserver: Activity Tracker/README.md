# First Django Webserver: Activity Tracker

## Purpose of this Assignment
This was my first assignment using the Django webserver framework. The assignment itself was to create an application where users could enter an activity and track when and how long they spend doing the activity. My objectives were to:
  * Implement a Django Application
  * Store data in a database
  * Implement simple model relationships
  * Build dynamic UI's using the Django template language

Stunning CSS wasn't a requirement for this project, so the styling is bland.

## How to Run
1. Run `$ poetry shell` in your terminal to spawn into a virtual environment.
2. Run `$ python manage.py runserver` in your terminal to start the server.
3. Go to your browser and go to "localhost:8000". The page should pop up.
