# Simple "About Me" Python Webserver

## Purpose of the Assignment: 
This was my introduction to the backend of web pages. I was assignmed to create a web server that:
  * Decodes and parses HTTP requests
  * Encodes valid HTTP responses
  * Uses the middleware pattern to implement logging and static file handling
  * Has a router to direct traffic to the proper endpoint
  * Has endpoints that take requests and produce responses
Nice CSS wasn't a requirement for this project, so the styling is bland. The main focus was the backend stuff.
