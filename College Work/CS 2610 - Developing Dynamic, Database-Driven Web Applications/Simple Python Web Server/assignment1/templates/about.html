    <p> My name is Brayden Brimhall. I am currently in my second semester of college at USU.
      I love playing sports, especially soccer because I have played that my whole life. I like to program
      games and things where I get to be creative. I plan to graduate Utah State with a degree in Computer Science
      and a minor in math.
